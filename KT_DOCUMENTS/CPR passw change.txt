NOTE: The one-time password must be changed within 7 days, as the userid otherwise will become inactive. The password must then be changed every 90 days, as the userid otherwise becomes inactive - it is recommended to change it every two months.
Password can be changed in the DAP system:
PROD: https://gws.cpr.dk/cpr-online-gws
You need to stop CPR service when you do a GCTP user reset.
Do not stop wrong. A third attempt will make the user inactive.
Only once can you do a password reset within a 24-hour time frame.

 
In the lab, stop the 3 environment cpr service and do the reset.
Then, in the configuration, add a password and start the service.
